# Motor Vehicle Thefts Analysis (New Zealand)

## 🔎 Project Overview
This project investigates the when, what, and where of vehicle thefts in New Zealand, using a SQL database and Excel for visual storytelling. The insights gathered from this project can help law enforcement and local governments better understand crime trends by day, region, and vehicle type.

## 🔧 Tools Used
* **MySQL (SQL)**: SQL queries for data transformation and analysis
* **Excel**: Data visualizations (bar chart, heatmap, map, and scatter plot)

## 📊 Key Findings
1. Vehicle thefts spike early in the week. Mondays and Tuesdays have the highest vehicle theft rates, with a notable drop-off in the midweek and on weekends.
2. Station wagons and Saloons are top targets. These vehicle types consistently show the highest theft counts.
3. Silver, white, and black are the most frequently stolen vehicle colors. Theft rates are highest for these three colors, regardless of the region type.
4. Luxury cars are disproportionately stolen in some segments. In certain vehicle categories (like saloons), luxury brands make up a larger share of thefts.
5. High-density regions have the most vehicle thefts. Regions like Auckland and Wellington top the theft rankings, aligned with high population and urban density.

## 🗺️ Geographic Insights
* Urban areas (Auckland, Wellington) show high theft clusters tied to population volume
* Less dense regions (Southland, Otago) show fewer thefts, but unique vehicle type preferences
* Regional vehicle preferences suggest the need for locally tailored interventions

## 💡Recommendations
* Schedule increased patrols and alerts on Mondays and Tuesdays 
* Promote anti-theft tools for high-risk vehicle types and colors
* Prioritize education and outreach efforts in urban regions with high theft counts
* Use data insights to inform insurance risk modeling and public safety campaigns
* Consider region-specific strategies based on vehicle usage behavior and density
